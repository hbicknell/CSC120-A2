What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
What did not work was trying to make a computer in a method, I was not succeful at rying to juggle that. As well some of the original attributes I tried were not successful. 

Advice I would give is don't overcomplicate it. You don't need to make this program flashy and I thought at the beginning you had to. This is not somethign where you need to make the interface extremely pretty or crazy. This is a straightforward assignment.
